                <p class="card-text">Founder of the Club Joan Gamper was the driving force behind FC Barcelona in its
                    first 25 years of
                    existence
                    FC Barcelona, founded in 1899 by a group of young foreigners living in Barcelona, was the result of
                    the
                    increasing popularity of football, and other British sports, across Europe. These origins have
                    conferred
                    upon
                    the Club its intercultural identity, multi-sport focus and its deeply-rooted allegiance to Barcelona
                    and
                    Catalonia. The foundation of the Club coincided with a time when people were becoming interested in
                    playing
                    sport in Catalonia; this social context and Catalonia’s idiosyncratic culture led to the creation of
                    a new
                    model
                    of modern leisure. Gamper, the Club’s founder, was the inspiration and driving force behind the
                    Club’s first
                    25
                    years. His commitment to FC Barcelona went far beyond his role as player, director and president.

                <p class="card-text">The team begins to collect silverware and the players begin to earn a name for
                    themselves
                    During the 1920s, football became a sport of the masses. FC Barcelona continued to attract huge
                    amounts of
                    support and was viewed as a dream team, comprising star players that became the first Barça idols,
                    such as
                    Samitier, Alcántara, Zamora, Sagi, Piera and Sancho.

                    This legendary team saw a growth of its fan base, which “prompted” the construction of the football
                    ground
                    at
                    Les Corts, in 1922; this was the first great Barça stadium. By 1923, the Club had in excess of
                    10,000
                    members.

                    Matches played against Barcelona’s other team, Espanyol, Barça’s biggest rival at that time, were
                    always met
                    with great expectation from devoted football fans, who followed the team to all its matches. The
                    team
                    enjoyed
                    many years of success at the Les Corts football ground.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Harsh repression and reprisals carried out by the civilian and military authorities
                    in the post-Civil War
                    years helped undermine the Club's very essence
                    The toughest moments experienced by FC Barcelona football club were the initial post-war years. The
                    Club
                    reached a point where it almost ceased to exist. Subject to relentless repression and reprisals by
                    the
                    authorities, the identity of the organisation was changed completely.

                    The purges also affected the players; anyone who had gone on the tour to Mexico and the United
                    States was
                    suspended for two years. Many of the players were exiled abroad. The Club’s coat of arms and name
                    were
                    changed because they were not deemed to be sufficiently Spanish, and the Club’s presidents were
                    scrupulously
                    selected by the sports authorities until 1946.

                    The team formation in subsequent years, however, led to more promising title victories in the 1950s.
                    For
                    many people, Barça’s matches at Les Corts represented an oasis of freedom during years of fear,
                    misery and
                    repression.</p>

                <p class="card-text">The possibility of signing foreign players once more meant that the dream of
                    signing Johan Cruyff became a
                    reality in 1974 with Montal as president
                    In 1969, Agustí Montal Costa won the elections and became president of the Club. His programme
                    insisted on
                    member involvement, and was committed to the idea that all members would see their opinions
                    reflected
                    through their votes. In 1973, Montal was re-elected president despite only the members'
                    representatives
                    being able to vote.

                    During his presidency, Montal avidly defended the restoration of Catalanism and was firmly opposed
                    to
                    centralism in football, as exercised by the Spanish Football Federation and the National Sports
                    Delegation.
                    His influence led Futbol Club Barcelona to begin to recover its symbols, starting with the
                    organisation’s
                    name that had been changed to sound more Spanish after the Civil War.

                    The outbreak of corruption associated with foreign players who falsified birth certificates in order
                    to
                    claim Spanish heritage and be admitted into Spanish football meant that it became possible to sign
                    foreign
                    players. Barça’s dream of signing Johan Cruyff began to look like a reality.</p>

                <p class="card-text">The centenary celebrations were a demonstration of what Barça means to people, an emotional journey through
                    the Club's history that lasted the whole year
                    Few organisations reach their one hundredth anniversary, for doing so requires consistence and continuity.
                    The aim of FC Barcelona's centenary was to celebrate the link between a glorious past and new hope for the
                    future.
        
                    The commemorative events saw an outpouring of Barça sentiment, and offered an emotional opportunity to spend
                    a year looking back at the Club's proud history. Several important figures from Catalan culture were
                    involved, as did the media and several major organisations. Famous artist Antoni Tàpies designed the
                    official Centenary poster, thus adding his name to list of internationally renowned artists and writers that
                    have helped aggrandise FC Barcelona's symbolic universe over the years.
        
                    The 1998-99 season, that of the Centenary celebrations, was also historic because of the many sporting
                    achievements: all four of the Club's professional sections (Football, Basketball, Handball and Roller
                    Hockey) won their respective league titles.
        
                    In 2003, newly elected president Joan Laporta brought with him a young and dynamic generation of directors
                    who totally changed the Club's image. His priority was to make it possible for the club's sporting successes
                    to have a knock-on effect on the more social aspects of the Club.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">THE RETURN OF GUARDIOLA </h5>
                <p class="card-text">In 2008, Josep Guardiola accepted the difficult job of replacing Frank Rijkaard as coach and end a run of
                    two seasons without a trophy. To do so, he applied the same style of play that was used when he was a player
                    at the Club, an attacking philosophy based on passing and it turned out to be a great success.
        
                    In his debut season, Guardiola won all three trophies available. After a winning start to the following
                    campaign in 2009/10, Barça became the team of the Six Trophies, all won in the calendar year of 2009. The
                    run of success continued with Guardiola claiming 14 titles of a possible 19 as coach in his four seasons in
                    charge. Guardiola became a reference point in football and his Barça side went beyond the strictly
                    footballing field.</p>
